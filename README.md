# LSTM-Based Time Series Prediction for Fuel Consumption in Guatemala üìäüñ•Ô∏è
This notebook presents a comprehensive analysis of the performance of two forecasting models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), applied to datasets related to diesel consumption and costs, as well as regular fuel imports in Guatemala.

Through this analysis, we aim not only to understand the behavior of these models but also to provide valuable insights into the trends and patterns of diesel consumption and costs in Guatemala, along with the dynamics of regular fuel imports.
